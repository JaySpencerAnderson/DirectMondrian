# Direct Mondrian Art Puzzle
## Divide a square into a number of non-congruent rectangles with the rectangle areas as close to each other as possible.

This is a direct solution to the Mondrian Art Puzzle.  It divides the square into N rectangles
by first taking a slice 1/Nth of the square from the top, then 1/(N-1) of the remainder off
the right side and so on.  It avoids congruent slices.
